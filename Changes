0.05

- Added DBI as a prereq.

- Pass catalog and schema name to all the DBI information methods used
  in Fey::Loader::DBI. This should make it easier to support these
  properly for future loaders, like Oracle or Sybase. Patch by Todd
  Hepler.


0.04    2008-02-05

- Moved test libraries to Fey-Test distro, and added it as a build
  prereq.


0.03    2008-02-03

- More test fixes. Skip tests gracefully (rather than failing badly)
  unless we have DBD::SQLite 1.14+.


0.02    2008-02-03

- Some tests failed when DBD::SQLite was not installed. These are now
  skipped.

- Require DBD::SQLite 1.14+ for SQLite support.


0.01    2008-02-02

- First release upon an unsuspecting world.
