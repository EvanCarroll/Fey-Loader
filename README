NAME
    Fey::Loader - Load your schema defintion from a DBMS

SYNOPSIS
      my $loader = Fey::Loader->new( dbh => $dbh );

      my $schema = $loader->make_schema();

DESCRIPTION
    `Fey::Loader' takes a `DBI' handle and uses it to construct a set of Fey
    objects representing that schema. It will attempt to use an appropriate
    DBMS subclass if one exists, but will fall back to using a generic
    loader otherwise.

    The generic loader simply uses the various schema information methods
    specified by `DBI'. This in turn depends on these methods being
    implemented by the driver.

METHODS
    This class provides the following methods:

  Fey::Loader->new( dbh => $dbh )

    Given a connected `DBI' handle, this method returns a new loader. If an
    appropriate subclass exists, it will be loaded and used. Otherwise, it
    will warn and fall back to using Fey::Loader::DBI.
